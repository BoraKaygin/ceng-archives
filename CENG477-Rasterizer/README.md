## Usage
- If needed, head into the Rasterization folder and compile program by using the "make" command in the terminal
- (On Windows) Run the rasterizer by using:
'''
./rasterizer.exe ./inputs/<input_name>.xml
'''

Will produce output image in ppm format.
- if the scene file includes multiple cameras, will produce multiple outputs.

Results will be practically identical to the sample outputs given in the outputs folder.
